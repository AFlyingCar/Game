Game
====

**Description**
A Touhou fan-game made with Python 2.7 utilizing the Pygame 1.9.1 modules.

**Future Plans**
  - Fully functional game with menus, music, images, levels, bosses, and bullet physics
  - Note: This game is still in very early indev, as it has almost none of the features that a Touhou game should have.
